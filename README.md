# Raycast Scripts

Script commands that I use with the MacOS launcher app, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

The scripts that are not created by me are sourced from the offical [script-commands Repo](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands). You can find a library of great free to use scripts over there.

Images used are also found from the [script-commands Repo](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands).
